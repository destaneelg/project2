#### Config Setup

3. Create an `orm.js` file inside `config` directory.
`orm.js`

   * In the `orm.js` file, create the methods that will execute the necessary MySQL commands in the controllers. These are the methods you will need to use in order to retrieve and store data in your database.

     * `insertOne()`
     * `updateOne()`
     * `deleteOne()`

   * Export the ORM object in `module.exports`.

#### Model setup

* Inside your `project` directory, create a folder named `models`.

  * In `models`, make a `project.js` file.

    * Inside `project.js`, import `orm.js` into `project.js`

    * Also inside `project.js`, create the code that will call the ORM functions using project specific input for the ORM.

    * Export at the end of the `project.js` file.

#### Controller setup

1. Inside your `project` directory, create a folder named `controllers`.

2. In `controllers`, create the `projects_controller.js` file.

3. Inside the `projects_controller.js` file, import the following:

   * Express
   * `project.js`

4. Create the `router` for the app, and export the `router` at the end of your file.
