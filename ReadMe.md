# Listly

 

## User Story
```
I need an application that can hold all my list and filter them by level of urgency. I need to have the ability to change a task as needed and check them off when complete.
```
## Website Functionality
```
GIVEN You are on listly
WHEN You add a new task
THEN You can see it on the list
WHEN When. you click List
THEN You can see all your task
WHEN You click new task
THEN You can add another task. 
```
## Obstacles faced during development
```
1.We jumped the gun initially, copying over files from random activities to try to ensure we had files to match all requirements, before understanding what all the requirements actually were.  This caused more time in reverse engineering to understand what the files/functions were doing, whether we needed them or not, and how to correctly require them, call them, or export them and correct file paths.
2.Due to jumping the gun with all the file additions, we needed to create a separate test repo (extra time spent) to start from scratch to get code that worked and aligned properly with all other files/code.
3.Finding modules/packages to install (still not sure what they are and how to find the right ones for the project)

```
## Instructions for future development
```
We would like to make this a collaborative app where you can work together
and make the urgency level create a corresponding due date.
